An E-commerce website using c++ containing a product recommendation system. 
It gives user shopping experience allowing the user to:
ðŸ“Œ Browse items from various categories

ðŸ“Œ Add items to a cart

ðŸ“ŒSearch for items 

ðŸ“ŒCalculate the bill along with discount

ðŸ“Œ Receive product suggestions based on the user shopping experience
OOP principles that are employed to make the project work:
âœ… ABSTRACTION: Abstract interface for all suggestion-related operations

âœ… POLYMORPHISM: Enables runtime decision-making to execute the correct implementation for different sections

âœ… INHERITENCE: Code reuse and organization, as all category-specific classes share the same base structure

âœ… ENCAPSULATION: Keeps category-specific logic modular and manageable.

âœ… EXCEPTION HANDLING: To check for invalid user inputs and maintain system stability and enhance user experience
